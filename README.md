Features of Git for Windows
Collaboration: Git makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. You can create branches for different features or bug fixes and then merge the changes back into the main branch when they are ready.
History: Git keeps a complete history of all changes to the code, so you can see how the code has evolved over time. You can view this history at any time, or use it to revert to a previous version if needed.
Integration: Git for Windows integrates with other tools, such as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, which are platforms for hosting and collaborating on Git projects.
Speed: Git is designed to be fast and efficient, so you can work with large codebases without experiencing any performance issues.
Version control: Git allows you to track changes to your code over time, so you can see who made changes, when they were made and what was changed. This makes it easier to understand how the code has evolved and to revert to previous versions if needed.
